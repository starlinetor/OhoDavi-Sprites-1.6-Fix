# OhoDavi-Sprites-1.6-Fix
Temporary fix for OhoDavi anime sprite mod. This just adds some missing sprites and changes the winter one to the default one. In this way you always see only OhoDavi sprites. 

# How to use 
Extract the file and Paste the "Portraits" folder into your "...Stardew Valley/Content/Portraits" folder (Dont forget back back up before you replace the file)

# Credits
All credits to OhoDavi for making the original sprites
