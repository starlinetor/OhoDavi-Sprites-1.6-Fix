# OhoDavi-Sprites-1.6-Fix
Temporary fix for OhoDavi anime sprite mod. This just adds some missing sprites and changes the winter one to the default one. In this way you always see only OhoDavi sprites. 
Note : this is missing most of the dafault sprites. Go on the mod site (link below) to download all the missing sprites.

# How to use 
Extract the file and Paste the "Portraits" folder into your "...Stardew Valley/Content/Portraits" folder (Dont forget back back up before you replace the file)
Note : you should see sobstitute 30 for winter sprites and sobstitute 3 for default sprites. 

# Credits
All credits to OhoDavi for making the original sprites
Original mod : https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1839
Everything i made is free to use (considering you already have OhoDavi permission), just give credits to me for the winter and updated default sprites.
